    Although DST is not used in the greater China today, it was a thing in
    eariler days. Hong Kong has employed DST from 1949 to 1979. China were in a
    few timezones (similar to US) instead of unified to UTC+8 in early days.<br />
    US DST rules were changed for a few times throughout the century. The last
    change was made in 2007.
  </li>
  <li>
    The seasons of the equinoxess and solstices are named so assuming
    observation from the Northern hemisphere, since the solar terms were an
    Chinese invention.<br />
    The seasons in the Southern hemisphere are the opposite.
  </li>
  <li>
    Due to the differences of astronomical observation data, introduction of UTC
    leap second, the data might have error up to a minute when compared to the
    other sources.
  </li>
  <li>
    The data is computed with the ERFA library. The computation program could be
    found on the github repo.
